# SimpleBackupBash-Linux-
Simple bash script to backup file names and directories.

Execute it in terminal with "./SimpleBackupBash.sh". 

The script asks you what folder to backup and where to put the output file. Then the name and location of all files and directories are grouped and separated depending if there are files or directories, so you can see easily what files do you have and in another section, what is the location of each file.

This is designed for you to know at least what files do you have in case you canÂ´t do a backup of your system because of lack of memory.
